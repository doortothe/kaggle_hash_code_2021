# kaggle_hash_code_2021
My project learning the concepts presented in the titular Kaggle competition.

List of major steps left to complete the project
1. Separate classes.py into individual class files to 
2. Research python optimization
3. Implement delay counting and csv exports in the simulation
4. Create function to write first draft of submission file to be used for machine learning
5. Implement machine learning (first draft)
6. Analyze results and use feedback to improve the machine learning
7. Add documentation to code to ease readability

List of possible machine learning solutions:
